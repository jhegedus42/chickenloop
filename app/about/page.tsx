                Chickenloop Job Board was created to connect watersports employers and qualified candidates without the hassle and stress that I have personally experienced. I spent far too much time and money in order to find suitable kitesurf, sailing and kayak instructors when setting up a watersports centre in India.

                When I started playing around with the Drupal website framework, I realised that a job board could be easily set up to help watersport center managers to avoid or at least reduce the trouble that I had to go through. Initially the job board was only dedicated to kitesurf and kiteboarding jobs, but with more and more general watersports jobs being listed, I expanded the job board to include all types of watersport jobs ranging from kitesurfing, windsurfing, sailing, SUP, to diving and surfing.

                My intention is purely to help the watersports community, and that is why advertising jobs and posting résumés on this site is completely free. To cover expenses, I do run advertising banners on the site.

                I look forward to being of service and hope the Chicken Loop International Watersports Job Board will be successful and prove useful to some of you.
